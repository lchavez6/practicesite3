            My work experience mainly consists of customer service and
            hospitality. Although I’ve always wanted to teach, I was too busy
            throughout college to tutor or substitute so I took up various
            serving jobs at different restaurants. Currently, I am working at a
            fine dining wine and steakhouse while also doing freelance Spanish
            interpreting. Before this, I worked as a teller at a bank, and also
            as a dispatcher for the Washington Dulles Airport. When it comes to
            my college education, I took the general required credits for my
            first two years, and when I became an English major, I chose
            Literature as my concentration. I took various African American and
            Literature classes, Latino Literature Classes, Creative Writing,
            Literary Theory, and varying Literature classes from different time
            period. When I got into graduate school, I also pursued English
            Literature but I got to take different classes such as poetry,
            Native American Literature, and British Literature.

            My goal was to become a teacher. I wanted to teach secondary
            education and be an English Teacher either in Loudoun County or in
            Fairfax County. I wanted to get my master’s degree so I could also
            teach AP classes as well as dual enrollment. I would also like to
            teach summer school and become an adjunct part-time at a nearby
            community college. I think that teaching would be very fulfilling
            because I will get to influence future minds and give back to my
            community. Most recently, I accepted a position as an English
            teacher at a middle school nearby and I’m very excited to start my
            new job.

              I thought I would be working on a thesis in order to graduate but
              instead I took two optional electives. However, I found I was most
              interested in 18th century American literature. If I had pursued a
              thesis, I would have written it about Kate Chopin's The Awakening
              and the ways that femininity is limited within the society that
              the novel takes place. I have also included term papers for the
              classes I found most interesting. Such as early American
              Literature, Literary Criticism, and even Shakespeare. I found that
              I geared mostly towards race relations and the complications of
              sexuality and gender.
